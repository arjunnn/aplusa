      <h2>Tuesday, 1st March'16 :</h2>
      <h3>8:00 AM :</h3>
      And there he was waiting for her to come online so that he could talk to her. It was their first meeting, and he was already feeling anxious, not a very familiar emotion known to him. Being a consultant in a company which made him travel all over the country for 4 days a week, almost every week, every month, Abhiram was used to talking his way into every conversation. But today was different. He was meeting a lady (or girl? or potential soulmate? or potential partner?). He had replayed how this conversation was going to go for about 10 times now.<br>
        <br>
      <h3>8:30 AM :</h3>
      It was a bright sunny morning in Hyderabad and Ashwini was just heading back home from the gym. She knew she had to FaceTime him in a couple of minutes. He had texted her exactly two days ago and they had hit off pretty well. They had discussed everything from blogging, interests, Likes & Dislikes, Life in the US, Netflix & episodes...they did have a lot in common.<br>
      When she got home, she quickly freshened up and texted him to ask if he was ready. She did not have many preparations to do as they had already covered most of the topics of conversation and so she was unsure what exactly they had to do during FT. Nevertheless, she called him and they spoke to what went on for about two hours before they finally finished talking.<br>
      <br>
      <h3>9:00 AM :</h3>
      And there she was. A dream too good to be true. He felt like he is going to re-invent the word love at first sight, but he knew at the back of his mind that there was already a word for it. He didn't believe it. Being in IT and having experience in ethical social hacking, Abhiram already had done his research online about her. Well, it wasn't too hard because she had a blog, and an Instagram, and a Facebook account, and a Dribbble account and a Twitter account. Too easy.
      The Sun was shining on her cone face. She had big inquisitive eyes. They spoke to each other. He was doing something which he never thought would happen in his life. Second chances are rare.<br>
      <br>
      He had called her from his downtown studio apartment in Denver, his Macbook Air on the kitchen counter he looked fresh, prepared and excited about the whole thing. The conversation had gone really well.<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Wednesday, 6th April'16</h2>
      Abhiram was on his flight to India, he was willing to travel all the way back to India just to meet her. He had booked tickets two days after the FT and he pretty much had her there. They continued to get to know each other the entire month and things looked bright. The conversations, the efforts he put to woo her, Ashwini was impressed.<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Friday, 8th April'16 :</h2>
      <h3>1:30 PM :</h3>
      And there he was waiting for her to come out and greet his family and him. He wasn't sure what to expect. He just travelled 18 hours back home for a second time in two months, because he knew it was worth it, SHE was worth it.<br>
      <br>
      On the other end, butterflies danced and sang in her tummy and Ashwini was getting restless. She decided to gossip with her cousins just to distract herself and after what seemed like 15 long minutes Ashwini was called downstairs to meet him and his family.<br>
      <br>
      And there she was, in real. It was real. The dream was over. The reality was better than the dream. He felt he was having a sensory-emotional overload. It was too close to doing a skydive. He didn't know what to say. She didn't know what to say. Having spoken to her to close a month now, he knew who she was.<br>
      <br>
      Looking into her eyes today, he knows he found his partner.The one he could spend the rest of his life with.<br>
      <br>
      "Do you like him, they asked. Yes; she said, to them."<br>
      "Will you marry me, he asked. Yes; she said, to him."<br>
      <br>
      <h2>Sunday, 10th April'16</h2>
      They got engaged.<br>
