## A Mix Of Two Worlds

### Tuesday, 1st March'16 :

*8:00 AM :*

And there he was waiting for her to come online so that he could talk to her. It was their first meeting, and he was already feeling anxious, not a very familiar emotion known to him. Being a consultant in a company which made him travel all over the country for 4 days a week, almost every week, every month, Abhiram was used to talking his way into every conversation. But today was different. He was meeting his potential soulmate. He had replayed how this conversation was going to go for about 10 times now.

*8:30 AM :*

It was a bright sunny morning in Hyderabad and Ashwini was just heading back home from the gym. She knew she had to FaceTime him in a couple of minutes. He had texted her exactly two days ago and they had hit off pretty well. They had discussed everything from blogging to interests, likes & dislikes to life in the US, Netflix and binge watching episodes. Everything. Everything two strangers could possibly talk. They did have a lot in common.
When she got home, she quickly freshened up and texted him to ask if he was ready. She did not have many preparations to do as they had already covered most of the topics of conversation and so she was unsure what exactly they had to do during FT. Nevertheless, she called him and they spoke, to what went on for about two hours before they finally finished talking.

*9:00 AM :*

He was calling from his downtown studio apartment in Denver, his Macbook Air on the kitchen counter he looked fresh, prepared and excited about the whole thing.

A designer by profession, Ashwini dreaded a partner who would be dull and absorbed by monotony. So when she first learnt he was into activities such as skydiving from his FB profile, She was relieved. "He could be anything but boring", she told herself.
His voice sounded familiar and had a certain air of confidence in his tone. The first noticeable feature about him would be the warm and friendly smile he carried.

"And there she is. A dream too good to be true." He told himself. He felt like he was going to re-invent the phrase love-at-first-sight, but he knew at the back of his mind that there was already a phrase for it. He didn't believe it. Being in IT and having experience in ethical social hacking, Abhiram already had done his research online about her. Well, it wasn't too hard because she had a blog, and an Instagram, and a Facebook account, and a Dribbble account and a Twitter account. Too easy.

The Sun was shining on her cone face. She had big inquisitive eyes. They spoke to each other. He was doing something which he never thought would happen in his life. Second chances are rare.


### Wednesday, 6th April'16 :

He just Abhiram was on his flight to India, he was willing to travel all the miles just to meet her. Not a day passed without Abhiram talking to her. He insisted spending time with her each day because he enjoyed being with her. Talking to her, seeing her speak about her passions, her life as a student, her work life, and her thoughts in general were the best ways he could spend time. He knew he had found the love of his life and he didn't want to waste a moment without her. They continued to get to know each other the entire month and things looked bright. The conversations, the efforts he put to woo her, Ashwini was impressed. She knew her answer.

###  Friday, 8th April'16 :

*1:30 PM :*

He was waiting for her to come out and greet his family and him. He wasn't sure what to expect. He had just travelled 18 hours back home for a second time in two months because he knew it was worth it, SHE was worth it.

On the other end, butterflies danced and sang in her tummy and Ashwini was getting restless. She decided to gossip with her cousins just to distract herself and after what seemed like 15 long minutes she was called downstairs.

And there she was, in real. "It was real. The dream was over", He told himself. The reality was better than the dream. He felt he was having a sensory-emotional overload. It was too close to doing a skydive. He didn't know what to say. She didn't know what to say. Having spoken to her close a month now, he knew who she was.

Looking into her eyes today, he knows he found his partner. The one he could spend the rest of his life with.

"Do you like him?" they asked. "Yes," she said to them.
"Will you marry me?" he asked. "Yes," she said to him.

### Sunday, 10th April'16:

They got engaged.

"Who am I?" You ask, I'm [Confused Smurf](https://twitter.com/confused_smurf). I'm an open source bot written in Python and I reside here on Twitter. 

I was conceived by Abhiram so that I can bug Ashwini on Twitter every day with a message containing a random Wikipedia link in it.
